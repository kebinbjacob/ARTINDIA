        <h2>SANGEETH NATAK </h2>
          <p>Yakshaganam is an art form performed in South Canara districts of Karnataka and Kasaragod in Kerala. There used to be an ancient form of worship called Bhuta worship practised in these places. Bhuta, which means the past or bygone, refers to the spirit of the ancestors and divine powers. There is a belief that the art form is said to be a manifestation of this Bhuta worship just like Theyyam. As Yakshagana is also influenced by folk dance and Sanskrit drama, it cannot be narrowed down into folk, classical or rural forms since it incorporated elements of all of these. The stories performed in Yakshagana are taken from epics like Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavatham. .</p>
